# Encoders
The `Util.Encoders` package defines the `Encoder` and `Decoder` types
which provide a mechanism to transform a stream from one format into
another format.  The basic encoder and decoder support `base16`, `base64`,
`base64url` and `sha1`.
The following code extract will encode in `base64`:

```Ada
C : constant Encoder := Util.Encoders.Create ("base64");
S : constant String := C.Encode ("Ada is great!");
```

and the next code extract will decode the `base64`:

```Ada
D : constant Decoder := Util.Encoders.Create ("base64");
S : constant String := D.Decode ("QWRhIGlzIGdyZWF0IQ==");
```

To use the packages described here, use the following GNAT project:

```Ada
with "utilada_sys";
```

## Error Correction Code
The `Util.Encoders.ECC` package provides operations to support error correction codes.
The error correction works on blocks of 256 or 512 bytes and can detect 2-bit errors
and correct 1-bit error.  The ECC uses only three additional bytes.
The ECC algorithm implemented by this package is implemented by several NAND Flash
memory.  It can be used to increase the robustness of data to bit-tempering when
the data is restored from an external storage (note that if the external storage has
its own ECC correction, adding another software ECC correction will probably not help).

The ECC code is generated by using the `Make` procedure that gets a block of 256 or
512 bytes and produces the 3 bytes ECC code.  The ECC code must be saved together with
the data block.

```Ada
Code : Util.Encoders.ECC.ECC_Code;
...
Util.Encoders.ECC.Make (Data, Code);
```

When reading the data block, you can verify and correct it by running again the
`Make` procedure on the data block and then compare the current ECC code with the
expected ECC code produced by the first call.  The `Correct` function is then called
with the data block, the expected ECC code that was saved with the data block and
the computed ECC code.

```Ada
New_Code : Util.Encoders.ECC.ECC_Code;
...
Util.Encoders.ECC.Make (Data, New_Code);
case Util.Encoders.ECC.Correct (Data, Expect_Code, New_Code) is
   when NO_ERROR | CORRECTABLE_ERROR => ...
   when others => ...
end case;
```
